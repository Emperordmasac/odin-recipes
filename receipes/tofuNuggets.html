    <h2>Tofu Nuggets Description</h2>
    <p>A vegetarian twist on chicken nuggets. Freezing and thawing the tofu gives it a chewier, meatier texture. You can freeze tofu ahead of time and store in freezer for up to a month.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) package extra-firm tofu, drained, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup ranch dressing</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Louisiana-style hot sauce (Optional)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice tofu block in half lengthwise. Cut each half into 1/3-inch slices to make bite-sized 'nuggets.' Place tofu in resealable plastic bags and freeze until firm and dry, at least 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place tofu slices on a microwave-safe plate. Heat in the microwave until defrosted, 2 to 5 minutes. Squeeze out water from the tofu and place slices over 3 layers of paper towels to drain. Pat dry with additional paper towels.</li>
        <li>Mix ranch dressing, hot sauce, sugar, and black pepper together in a bowl. Pour bread crumbs into a separate bowl. Coat tofu slices with the ranch mixture and roll in bread crumbs until thoroughly coated.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tofu nuggets are golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Cooking Notes</h4>
    <p>Instead of microwaving, thaw tofu in the refrigerator if you have time.</p>
